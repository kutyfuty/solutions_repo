# Problem 1

# Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## 1. Motivation and Approach

Calculating the equivalent resistance of a circuit is a key task in electrical engineering. Traditional methods (series and parallel rules) can get complicated for complex circuits. Graph theory offers a better way by representing the circuit as a graph:

- **Nodes:** Junctions in the circuit.

- **Edges:** Resistors, with weights as resistance values.

We’ll simplify the graph step-by-step by:

- Finding **series connections** (resistors in a chain).

- Finding **parallel connections** (resistors between the same two nodes).

- Reducing the graph until we’re left with one equivalent resistance.

## 2. Algorithm Description

### Steps to Simplify the Graph

1. **Identify Series Connections:**
   - Look for nodes with exactly two neighbors (degree 2).

   - If node B is between nodes A and C with resistors $R_1$ (A-B) and $R_2$ 
   (B-C), replace with a single resistor $R = R_1 + R_2$ between A and C.

   - Remove node B.

2. **Identify Parallel Connections:**

   - Look for multiple edges between the same two nodes (e.g., nodes A and B with resistors $R_1$, $R_2$).

   - Replace with a single resistor using the parallel formula: $R = \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$.

   - Remove extra edges.

3. **Repeat:** Keep applying series and parallel reductions until only two nodes remain (the start and end nodes). The resistance between them is the equivalent resistance.

### Handling Nested Configurations

- The algorithm iteratively simplifies the graph, so nested series-parallel combinations are handled naturally.

- For complex graphs with cycles, we may need additional steps (like delta-star transformations), but for series-parallel networks, this approach works directly.

## 3. Python Implementation

We’ll use `networkx` to represent the circuit as a graph and implement the simplification algorithm. The code will:

- Accept a graph with resistors as edge weights.

- Simplify the graph iteratively.

- Output the equivalent resistance.

- Test on three example circuits.

## 5. Outputs and Explanation

### Example 1: Simple Series Circuit

- **Graph:** Two resistors in series (2Ω and 3Ω).

- **Reduction:** $R_{\text{eq}} = 2 + 3 = 5 \, \Omega$.

- **Output:** Matches the expected 5.0 Ω.

### Example 2: Simple Parallel Circuit

- **Graph:** Two resistors in parallel (2Ω and 3Ω).

- **Reduction:** $R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{2 \times 3}{2 + 3} = 1.2 \, \Omega$.

- **Output:** Matches the expected 1.2 Ω.

### Example 3: Nested Series-Parallel Circuit

- **Graph:** Resistors in a nested configuration:

  - 0-1: 2Ω

  - 1-2: 3Ω, 2-3: 4Ω (series: 3 + 4 = 7Ω)

  - 1-3: 6Ω (parallel with 7Ω: $\frac{6 \times 7}{6 + 7} = 3.23 \, \Omega$)

  - 0-1 in series with 3.23Ω: $2 + 3.23 = 5.23 \, \Omega$

- **Output:** The code computes this iteratively, but note that the expected value in the problem (4.0 Ω) may indicate a different interpretation of the circuit. Let’s verify manually:

  - 1-2-3 (3Ω + 4Ω = 7Ω) is in parallel with 1-3 (6Ω), so $R_{\text{parallel}} $
  
  - $\frac{6 \times 7}{6 + 7} = 3.23 \, \Omega$.

  - Then, 0-1 (2Ω) in series: $2 + 3.23 = 5.23 \, \Omega$.

  - The expected 4.0 Ω might be a typo or a different configuration. The computed 5.23 Ω is correct for the given graph.

### Visuals
- Each example includes a graph plot showing nodes (junctions) and edges (resistors) with their resistance values.

## 6. Algorithm Efficiency and Improvements

### Efficiency
- **Time Complexity:** Each simplification (series or parallel) reduces the graph size. In the worst case, we iterate $O(N)$ times (where $N$ is the number of nodes), and each iteration involves checking nodes and edges, leading to $O(N \cdot (N + E))$ complexity, where $E$ is the number of edges.

- **Space Complexity:** $O(N + E)$ to store the graph.

### Improvements
- **Non-Series-Parallel Graphs:** The current algorithm assumes the circuit is series-parallel. For complex graphs (e.g., bridges or cycles), we’d need delta-star transformations.

- **Automation:** Add a check for non-series-parallel graphs and raise a warning.

- **Visualization:** Show intermediate steps of graph reduction for educational purposes.

## 7. Why Graph Theory Helps

Graph theory simplifies the problem by:

- Providing a clear structure (nodes and edges).

- Allowing systematic reduction (series and parallel rules).

- Enabling automation for complex circuits.

This approach is especially useful in real-world applications like circuit design software, where manual simplification is impractical.
