Theoretical Foundation Projectile motion is a classic application of Newton\u2019s laws in two dimensions. Let\u2019s derive the governing equations from first principles, assuming no air resistance for now (we\u2019ll revisit this later). Deriving the Equations of Motion A projectile is launched with an initial velocity \\(v_0\\) at an angle \\(\\theta\\) from the horizontal. The acceleration due to gravity \\(g\\) acts downward. We break the motion into horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components: Initial conditions: Horizontal velocity: \\(v_{x0} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) Vertical velocity: \\(v_{y0} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) Initial position: \\((x_0, y_0) = (0, 0)\\) (assuming launch from the origin) Acceleration: Horizontal: \\(a_x = 0\\) Vertical: \\(a_y = -g\\) Using the kinematic equations \\(v = v_0 + at\\) and \\(s = s_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} a t^2\\) : Horizontal motion: $$ x(t) = v_{x0} t = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ Vertical motion: $$ y(t) = v_{y0} t + \\frac{1}{2} a_y t^2 = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Time of Flight The projectile hits the ground when \\(y(t) = 0\\) . Solve: $$ v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0 $$ Factorize: $$ t \\left( v_0 \\sin\\theta - \\frac{1}{2} g t \\right) = 0 $$ Solutions: \\(t = 0\\) (launch) or: $$ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ This is the time of flight \\(T\\) . Range Equation The horizontal range \\(R\\) is the distance traveled when \\(t = T\\) : $$ R = x(T) = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ Using the identity \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 2 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta\\) : $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} $$ Family of Solutions This equation reveals a family of solutions parameterized by: - \\(v_0\\) : Initial velocity scales the range quadratically. - \\(g\\) : Gravitational acceleration inversely affects the range. - \\(\\theta\\) : The angle determines the sinusoidal variation. 2. Analysis of the Range Dependence on Angle The term \\(\\sin 2\\theta\\) peaks at 1 when \\(2\\theta = 90^\\circ\\) , or \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) , giving the maximum range: $$ R_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0^2}{g} $$ - At \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(90^\\circ\\) , \\(\\sin 2\\theta = 0\\) , so \\(R = 0\\) . - The range is symmetric about \\(45^\\circ\\) (e.g., \\(\\theta = 30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) yield the same range). Influence of Parameters Initial Velocity ( \\(v_0\\) ) : Doubling \\(v_0\\) quadruples \\(R\\) , due to the \\(v_0^2\\) term. Gravity ( \\(g\\) ) : On the Moon ( \\(g \\approx 1.62 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ) versus Earth ( \\(g \\approx 9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ), the range increases significantly for the same \\(v_0\\) and \\(\\theta\\) . 3. Practical Applications Sports : In soccer or golf, players adjust \\(\\theta\\) and \\(v_0\\) to optimize range, though air resistance and spin complicate the ideal \\(45^\\circ\\) . Engineering : Artillery design considers terrain and drag, requiring adjusted angles. Astrophysics : Trajectories on other planets (different \\(g\\) ) or in space (negligible \\(g\\) ) adapt this model. For uneven terrain (launch height \\(h \\neq 0\\) ), the time of flight becomes the positive root of: $$ h + v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = 0 $$ This modifies the range, often reducing the optimal angle below \\(45^\\circ\\) . 4. Implementation Here\u2019s a Python script to simulate and visualize the range versus angle: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt def range_projectile(v0, theta_deg, g=9.81): theta = np.radians(theta_deg) return (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * theta)) / g # Parameters v0_values = [10, 20, 30] # m/s g_values = [9.81, 1.62] # Earth, Moon theta = np.linspace(0, 90, 91) # 0 to 90 degrees # Plotting plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) for v0 in v0_values: for g in g_values: R = range_projectile(v0, theta, g) label = f'v0 = {v0} m/s, g = {g} m/s\u00b2' plt.plot(theta, R, label=label) plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)') plt.ylabel('Range (meters)') plt.title('Range vs. Angle of Projection') plt.legend() plt.grid(True) plt.show() # Maximum range example v0 = 20 g = 9.81 theta_max = 45 R_max = range_projectile(v0, theta_max, g) print(f\"Max range at 45\u00b0 with v0 = {v0} m/s, g = {g} m/s\u00b2: {R_max:.2f} m\") Output Explanation The plot shows \\(R\\) versus \\(\\theta\\) for different \\(v_0\\) and \\(g\\) . Peaks at \\(45^\\circ\\) confirm the theoretical maximum. Higher \\(v_0\\) or lower \\(g\\) increases the range, as expected. Discussion and Limitations Idealized Model This model assumes: - No air resistance. - Flat terrain ( \\(h = 0\\) ). - Constant \\(g\\) . Real-World Adjustments Drag : Introduces a velocity-dependent force, reducing range and shifting the optimal angle (typically < \\(45^\\circ\\) ). Wind : Adds a horizontal force, altering the trajectory. Numerical Simulation : For drag, solve the differential equations numerically (e.g., using Runge-Kutta methods) since no closed-form solution exists. Suggestions Incorporate drag with \\(F_d = -k v\\) or terrain effects by adjusting the landing condition. Simulate these using Python libraries like scipy.integrate.odeint .","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#1-theoretical-foundation","text":"Projectile motion is a classic application of Newton\u2019s laws in two dimensions.
