The equations governing projectile motion involve both linear and quadratic relationships. This project aims to analyze how the range of a projectile depends on its angle of projection. Task 1. Theoretical Foundation Governing Equations Projectile motion can be described using the following basic equations, considering no air resistance and launch from the ground: - Horizontal motion: \\( x(t) = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\) - Vertical motion: \\( y(t) = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\) Range Equation The horizontal range \\( R \\) is given by: [ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} ] 2. Analysis of the Range Dependence on Angle The range depends sinusoidally on the angle \\( \\theta \\) , with a maximum at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . Influence of Parameters Increasing \\( v_0 \\) increases the range. Increasing \\( g \\) decreases the range. 3. Practical Applications Real-World Adaptations On uneven terrain, consider different launch and landing heights. Air resistance requires numerical methods for solutions. 4. Implementation Let's create a simple Python script to simulate and visualize the range as a function of the angle of projection: ```python import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Define the parameters v0 = 20 # initial velocity in m/s g = 9.81 # acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2 angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) # angle range from 0 to 90 degrees Calculate the range for each angle ranges = (v0**2 * np.sin(np.radians(2 * angles))) / g Plot the results plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6)) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label='Range vs Angle') plt.xlabel('Angle of Projection (degrees)', fontsize=14, fontweight='medium') plt.ylabel('Range (m)', fontsize=14, fontweight='medium') plt.title('Projectile Range as a Function of Launch Angle', fontsize=16, fontweight='medium') plt.grid(True) plt.legend() plt.show()","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#motivation","text":"Projectile motion offers a rich playground for exploring fundamental principles of physics.
